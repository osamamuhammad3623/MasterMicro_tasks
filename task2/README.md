# MasterMicro task 2
# Matrix Flatten

## 1. Problem Description
- A 3D matrix is to be stored in a 1D vector (flattened).
- The 3D matrix is of size n x m x p and is indexed by i, j, k.
- The 1D vector is of size q and is indexed by y.

## 2. Requirements
- Implement the following functions:
  1. Create a 1D vector suitable for storing the 3D matrix.
  2. Convert the 3D matrix index (i, j, k) to a suitable 1D vector index (y). Must be O(1)
